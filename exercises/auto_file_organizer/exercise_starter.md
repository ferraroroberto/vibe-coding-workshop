# Exercise: The automated File Organizer

## The Goal

Your "Downloads" folder and project workspace have become a chaotic mess of files. 
There are CSVs mixed with PDFs, Excel reports, and random text files. It's time to clean up.

**Your Objective:** Write a Python script that automatically organizes these files into neat subfolders based on their type (e.g., all `.csv` files go into a `Data` folder, `.pdf` into `Docs`).

### Expected Outcome

When you run your script, the files in the `data` folder should be moved into these new subfolders:
*   **Spreadsheets/** (for `.xlsx`, `.csv`)
*   **Documents/** (for `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`)
*   **Images/** (for `.png`, `.jpg`)
*   **Others/** (for anything else)

Good luck!
