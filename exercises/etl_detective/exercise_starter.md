# Exercise: ETL 2 - The Detective

**Goal:** Clean a "dirty" dataset by identifying duplicates, handling negative numbers, and filtering out errors.

---

### The Scenario
You are a Data analyst at *Global Widgets Inc.*
You successfully merged the sales files in the previous project. However, the Finance team has rejected your report.
"The numbers don't add up," they said. "We see the same Order ID appearing twice, and why do we have negative sales? Are we paying people to take our products?"

Your job is to act as a detective: separate the good data from the bad.

### Your Mission
1.  **Load** the `combined_sales.csv` file.
2.  **Find and Remove** duplicate `Order_ID`s (glitch in the system).
3.  **Filter out** negative numbers in the `Revenue` column (erroneous refunds).
4.  **Save** the clean dataset as `clean_sales_data.csv`.

**(Optional) Tier 2 Challenge:**
*   Identify "Suspiciously High" revenue transactions (outliers) that are statistically impossible (3 standard deviations from the mean).
