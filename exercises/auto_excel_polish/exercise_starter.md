# Exercise: The Professional Polish ("The Bridge")

## The Goal
Your boss loved the data in `final_report.xlsx`, but she complained that it looks "too plain" and the columns are too narrow to read. She wants:
1.  **Professional Headers:** Bold text with a nice blue background.
2.  **Readable Columns:** All columns should auto-fit to the content size.
3.  **High-Highlights:** Any Revenue over $10,000 should be highlighted in Green.

**Your Mission:**
Instead of manually clicking around in Excel every quarter, write a Python script that takes the raw data and applies this professional formatting automatically.

## Expected Output
A new Excel file named `polished_report.xlsx` that is formatted perfectly.
