# Exercise: The Great Merger

## The Goal
In this exercise, you will automate a common reporting task: consolidating multiple Excel files into a single dataset. You will learn how to load data from Excel, combine it using Python, and export the cleanup result. 

## The Scenario
Your boss has emailed you three separate Excel files containing quarterly sales data (Q1, Q2, and Q3). She needs a single "Year-To-Date" report by lunchtime. 

Copy-pasting manually is slow and prone to errors. Instead, you will use Python to:
1. Load the three files.
2. Stack them into one master table.
3. Verify the data count.
4. Export the result to a CSV file.

## Expected Output
A single file named `combined_sales.csv` containing all records from the three quarterly files.
