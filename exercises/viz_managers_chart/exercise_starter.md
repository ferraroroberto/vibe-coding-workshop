# Exercise: The Manager's Chart

## The Goal
Create a professional-grade bar chart showing **Total Revenue per Product Category** for the board meeting. The chart must effectively communicate sales performance to management, featuring clear titles and proper currency formatting.

The Manager is picky about presentation—raw, unformatted charts will not be accepted.

## Expected Outcome
A clean, professional bar chart displayed (or saved) that shows which business categories are driving the most revenue for the year.
