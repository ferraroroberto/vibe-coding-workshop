# Exercise: Viz 4 - The Geographic Heatmap (The Global View)

## The Goal

The VP of International Sales wants to see *where* the money is coming from — not in a table, but on an actual map. She wants to open a single file and instantly see hotspots of sales activity across the globe, with the ability to click on cities for details.

**Your Mission:**
Build an interactive geographic visualization using **Folium** that displays:
1. A **heatmap layer** showing intensity of sales revenue by city.
2. **Circle markers** for each city, sized by total revenue, with popup details.
3. A **layer control** so the user can toggle between the heatmap and the markers.
4. A mini **legend** or title overlay explaining the visualization.

**Expected Outcome:**
A self-contained `sales_heatmap.html` file that opens in any browser showing an interactive world map with sales data overlaid. Clicking on a city marker reveals total revenue, number of orders, and top product. This is the kind of deliverable that gets projected in a board room.
