# Bonus: Viz Geo Heatmap (The Global View)

## The Scenario
The VP of International Sales wants to see *where* the money is coming from — not in a table, but on an actual map. She wants to open a single file and instantly see hotspots of sales activity across the globe, with the ability to click on cities for details.

## Your Mission
Build an interactive geographic visualization using **Folium** (or Leaflet/Plotly): a **heatmap layer** showing sales intensity by city, **circle markers** sized by revenue with popup details, a **layer control** to toggle views, and a **legend** or title overlay.

## Expected Outcome
A self-contained `sales_heatmap.html` file that opens in any browser showing an interactive world map with sales data overlaid. Clicking on a city reveals total revenue, number of orders, and top product — the kind of deliverable that gets projected in a board room.
