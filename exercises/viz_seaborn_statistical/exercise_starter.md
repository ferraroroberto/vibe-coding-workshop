# Exercise: Viz 6 - The Statistical Dashboard (Seaborn Multi-Panel)

## The Goal

The Data Science team is presenting at the quarterly all-hands meeting. They need a single image — a **multi-panel statistical dashboard** — that tells the full story of employee performance and satisfaction in one glance. Each panel should show a different statistical perspective using the best chart type for that data shape.

**Your Mission:**
Build a polished, multi-panel figure using Seaborn that combines:
1. A **correlation heatmap** showing relationships between numerical variables (revenue, satisfaction, experience, deals closed).
2. A **violin plot** comparing the distribution of satisfaction scores across departments.
3. A **pair plot** (scatter matrix) showing all numeric variable relationships colored by department.
4. A **box + strip combo plot** showing revenue distribution by seniority level with individual data points overlaid.

**Expected Outcome:**
A set of publication-quality PNG images:
- `correlation_heatmap.png` — annotated heatmap with diverging colors.
- `satisfaction_violins.png` — split violin plot by department.
- `metrics_pairplot.png` — scatter matrix colored by department.
- `revenue_by_seniority.png` — combined box + strip plot.

These are the kind of charts that make a data team look world-class.
