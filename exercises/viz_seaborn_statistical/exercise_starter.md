# Bonus: Seaborn Statistical (The Statistical Dashboard)

## The Scenario
The Data Science team is presenting at the quarterly all-hands meeting. They need a single image — a **multi-panel statistical dashboard** — that tells the full story of employee performance and satisfaction in one glance. Each panel should show a different statistical perspective using the best chart type for that data shape.

## Your Mission
Build a polished, multi-panel figure using **Seaborn**: a **correlation heatmap** (relationships between revenue, satisfaction, experience), a **violin plot** (satisfaction across departments), a **pair plot** (scatter matrix colored by department), and a **box + strip combo** (revenue by seniority with overlaid points).

## Expected Outcome
Publication-quality PNG images: `correlation_heatmap.png`, `satisfaction_violins.png`, `metrics_pairplot.png`, `revenue_by_seniority.png`. These are the kind of charts that make a data team look world-class.
