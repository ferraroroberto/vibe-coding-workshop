# Exercise Card: Viz 6 - The Statistical Dashboard (Seaborn Multi-Panel)

## Title & Problem Statement
**The Statistical Dashboard: Professional Multi-Chart Analysis with Seaborn**

Seaborn excels at statistical visualization — it goes beyond simple bar charts into distribution analysis, correlation mapping, and multi-variable exploration. This exercise teaches you the chart types that data scientists actually use day-to-day: heatmaps to spot correlations, violin plots to compare distributions, pair plots to explore relationships, and box plots with overlaid data points for granular comparisons. Each chart type is purpose-built for a specific analytical question, and knowing when to use which one is the mark of a skilled analyst.

## Difficulty & Estimated Time
*   **Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced (Statistical Visualization Focus)
*   **Estimated Time:** 35-45 Minutes

## Required Libraries
*   `pandas`: Data loading and wrangling.
*   `numpy`: Generating correlated data and numerical operations.
*   `seaborn`: The full toolkit — `heatmap()`, `violinplot()`, `pairplot()`, `boxplot()`, `stripplot()`.
*   `matplotlib.pyplot`: Layout control, subplot grids, saving.

## Didactic Step-by-Step

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
**Concept:** Statistical charts need multiple numerical columns with meaningful relationships.
*   **Action:** Load the employee performance CSV. Check correlations with `df.corr()` and distributions with `df.describe()`.

### 2. Correlation Heatmap
**Concept:** A heatmap visually encodes a correlation matrix — values from -1 (inverse) to +1 (perfect correlation).
*   **Action:** Compute `df[numeric_cols].corr()`, then use `sns.heatmap(annot=True, cmap='RdBu_r', center=0)`. The `annot=True` prints the actual numbers inside each cell.

### 3. Violin Plot
**Concept:** A violin plot shows the *distribution shape* of data per category — it's a box plot + density plot combined.
*   **Action:** Use `sns.violinplot(data=df, x='Department', y='Satisfaction', hue='Gender', split=True)` to compare distributions side-by-side within each category.

### 4. Pair Plot (Scatter Matrix)
**Concept:** A pair plot creates a grid of scatter plots for every pair of numeric variables, with histograms on the diagonal.
*   **Action:** Use `sns.pairplot(df, hue='Department', vars=['Revenue', 'Satisfaction', 'Experience', 'Deals_Closed'])`. It's the fastest way to find relationships in your data.

### 5. Box + Strip Combo
**Concept:** A box plot shows summary statistics (median, quartiles, outliers) while a strip plot overlays the actual individual data points.
*   **Action:** Draw `sns.boxplot()` first, then overlay `sns.stripplot()` on the same axes with `alpha=0.4` and `jitter=True`.

## Tips for Coding and Vibe-Coding

1.  **`annot=True` on heatmaps is non-negotiable:** Without the numbers, a heatmap is just a pretty color grid. Always annotate.
2.  **Diverging colormaps for correlations:** Use `'RdBu_r'` or `'coolwarm'` with `center=0` so that positive correlations are red and negative are blue.
3.  **`split=True` on violins:** When you have a binary `hue` (e.g., Gender), `split=True` puts both halves in the same violin for direct comparison.
4.  **Pair plots are slow with big data:** If you have 10,000+ rows, sample first: `df.sample(500)`. Pair plots create N^2 scatter plots.
5.  **Layer box + strip carefully:** Draw `boxplot` first with `showfliers=False` (hide outlier dots), then overlay `stripplot` to avoid duplicate outlier rendering.

## Copilot Master Prompt
*You can use this prompt to generate the solution code:*

> "I have a pandas DataFrame with columns: Employee_ID, Department, Gender, Seniority, Years_Experience, Satisfaction_Score, Revenue_Generated, Deals_Closed, Training_Hours.
> Using Seaborn, create 4 separate professional charts and save each as a PNG at 150 DPI:
> 1. A correlation heatmap of all numeric columns with annotations, using the 'RdBu_r' colormap centered at 0.
> 2. A split violin plot of Satisfaction_Score by Department, with hue=Gender and split=True.
> 3. A pair plot of Revenue_Generated, Satisfaction_Score, Years_Experience, Deals_Closed colored by Department.
> 4. A combined box + strip plot of Revenue_Generated by Seniority.
> Use the 'whitegrid' style and 'talk' context for all charts."
