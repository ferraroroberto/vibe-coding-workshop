# Bonus: D3 Force Network (The Relationship Map)

## The Scenario
The VP of Partnerships wants to understand how departments, products, and clients are connected. Who buys what? Which departments share the same top clients? Which products are frequently purchased together? Spreadsheets can't show relationships — you need a **network graph**.

## Your Mission
Using Python to prepare the data and **D3.js** in the browser, build an interactive force-directed network graph: **nodes** for departments, products, and clients; **edges** for purchase relationships; **node color** by entity type; **node size** by revenue; **drag** to explore clusters; **tooltips** on hover.

## Expected Outcome
A self-contained `relationship_network.html` file that opens in a browser and shows a physics-based network that self-organizes into clusters. Drag nodes, hover for details, zoom in/out — and reveal hidden patterns like which clients are central to the business.
