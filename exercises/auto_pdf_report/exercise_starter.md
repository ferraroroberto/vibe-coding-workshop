# Bonus: Auto PDF Report (The Executive Deliverable)

## The Scenario
The CFO doesn't use Excel. She doesn't open HTML files. She wants a **PDF** — clean, branded, with charts and tables embedded — that she can print, annotate, and forward to the board. Every quarter, you've been manually screenshotting charts, pasting them into Word, and exporting to PDF. No more.

## Your Mission
Build a Python script that automatically generates a multi-page PDF report: a **cover page** with title and branding, a **KPI summary section**, **embedded bar and pie charts** (Revenue by Category), a **formatted data table** (top 10 transactions), and **page footers** with page numbers.

## Expected Outcome
A polished `quarterly_report.pdf` that looks professionally designed — but was generated entirely by Python in seconds. Run it once, and it works every quarter with fresh data.
