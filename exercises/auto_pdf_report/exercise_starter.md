# Exercise: Auto 3 - The PDF Report Generator (The Executive Deliverable)

## The Goal

The CFO doesn't use Excel. She doesn't open HTML files. She wants a **PDF** — clean, branded, with charts and tables embedded — that she can print, annotate, and forward to the board. Every quarter, you manually screenshot charts, paste them into Word, and export to PDF. No more.

**Your Mission:**
Build a Python script that automatically generates a multi-page PDF report containing:
1. A **cover page** with the report title, date, and company branding.
2. A **KPI summary section** with key metrics displayed prominently.
3. An **embedded bar chart** (Revenue by Category) generated by matplotlib and inserted into the PDF.
4. An **embedded pie chart** (Revenue distribution) on the same or next page.
5. A **data table** showing the top 10 transactions formatted with alternating row colors.
6. A **footer** on every page with page numbers and a confidentiality notice.

**Expected Outcome:**
A polished `quarterly_report.pdf` file that looks like it was designed by a professional — but was generated entirely by Python in seconds. Run it once, and it works every quarter with fresh data.
