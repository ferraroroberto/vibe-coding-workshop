# Bonus: Interactive Dashboard (The Wow Factor)

## The Scenario
The CEO loved your static charts, but now she wants something she can *interact* with — filter by region, hover over data points, and share with the board via a simple link. Static PNGs won't cut it anymore.

## Your Mission
Build a stunning, interactive HTML dashboard using **Plotly** (or Streamlit/Dash): a **KPI summary row** (Total Revenue, Orders, Avg Order Value), a **sunburst chart** (Revenue by Region → Category → Product), a **time-series line chart** filterable by region, and a **top 10 products bar chart** with hover tooltips.

## Expected Outcome
A single self-contained `dashboard.html` file that opens in any browser — no server required. It should look polished, professional, and interactive. This is the kind of deliverable that makes people say *"You did this with Python?!"*
