# Exercise: Viz 3 - The Interactive Dashboard (The Wow Factor)

## The Goal

The CEO loved your static charts, but now she wants something she can *interact* with — filter by region, hover over data points, and share with the board via a simple link. Static PNGs won't cut it anymore.

**Your Mission:**
Build a stunning, interactive HTML dashboard using **Plotly** that contains:
1. A **KPI summary row** at the top (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value).
2. A **sunburst chart** showing Revenue breakdown by Region → Category → Product.
3. A **time-series line chart** with revenue trends over time, filterable by region.
4. A **top 10 products bar chart** with hover tooltips showing detail.

**Expected Outcome:**
A single self-contained `dashboard.html` file that opens in any browser — no server required. It should look polished, professional, and interactive. This is the kind of deliverable that makes people say *"You did this with Python?!"*
