# Student Scorecard: The Report Generator

## Exercise Title
**Viz 2: Multi-Sheet Excel Reporting**

## The Goal
The dashboard looks great, but management always wants the "raw numbers" in Excel. 
Your task is to take the cleaned sales data and generate a single professional Excel file (`final_report.xlsx`) containing two separate tabs:
1. **"Executive Summary"**: A high-level table showing Total Revenue by Category.
2. **"Backing Data"**: The full, detailed dataset for auditing purposes.

You will use Python's `pandas` library to act as a bridge between raw data and the final corporate report.
