# Intro: Hello World - The First Flight

## The Goal

Verify that your "cockpit" (VS Code + Python) is fully operational. You will write your first lines of code to print a message to the screen, perform a business calculation, and automate a repetitive task using a loop.

## Steps

1. **The Environment:** Create a new file named `hello.py`.
2. **The First Prompt:** Use GitHub Copilot to ask: "How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?". Run the code.
3. **The Calculator:** Ask Copilot: "Create a variable for revenue = 1000 and cost = 400. Calculate profit and print it."
4. **The Loop:** Ask Copilot: "Write a loop that prints numbers 1 to 5."
