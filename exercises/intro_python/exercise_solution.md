# Intro: Hello World - The First Flight

## Problem Statement

It's your first day as a Data Analyst. You have installed VS Code and Python, but the blank screen looks intimidating. You need to prove to your boss (and yourself) that your setup is working correctly by performing three fundamental tasks: outputting text, calculating a business metric, and running a loop.

## Difficulty & Estimated Time

*   **Difficulty:** Beginner
*   **Time:** 20 Minutes

## Required Libraries

*   **None (Standard Python Library):** This exercise focuses on pure Python syntax and environment familiarity.

## Didactic Step-by-Step

1.  **The Environment:**
    *   Open your VS Code editor.
    *   Create a new file named `hello.py` in your workspace. This tells VS Code to interpret your text as Python code.

2.  **The First Prompt (Hello World):**
    *   In the file, type a comment or ask Copilot: *"How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?"*
    *   **Logic:** The `print()` function is the most basic tools for outputting information to the terminal.
    *   **Outcome:** You should see `Hello World` in the terminal when you run the file.

3.  **The Calculator (Variables & Math):**
    *   Ask Copilot: *"Create a variable for revenue = 1000 and cost = 400. Calculate profit and print it."*
    *   **Logic:**
        *   **Variables:** Think of `revenue` and `cost` as labeled boxes storing numbers.
        *   **Math:** `profit = revenue - cost` performs the calculation.
        *   **Print:** Displays the result (`600`).

4.  **The Loop (Automation):**
    *   Ask Copilot: *"Write a loop that prints numbers 1 to 5."*
    *   **Logic:** A `for` loop repeats an action. `range(1, 6)` generates numbers starting at 1 and stopping *before* 6.
    *   **Outcome:** The terminal will list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

## Tips for Coding & Vibe-Coding

1.  **Comments are Key:** In Python, lines starting with `#` are comments. Copilot reads these to understand what you want to do.
2.  **Run Often:** Don't write 50 lines of code at once. Write 3 lines, run it, fix it, then continue.
3.  **The Terminal:** This is your command center. If you see text there, your code is running.
4.  **Indentation Matters:** Python uses whitespace (indentation) to define blocks of code (like inside a loop). Copilot handles this for you, but keep an eye on it.
5.  **Ctrl+Enter:** Use this shortcut (or the "Play" button) to run your code quickly.

## Copilot Master Prompt

If you want to generate the entire solution at once, paste this into Copilot Chat:

> "Write a simple Python script for a beginner. First, print 'Hello World'. Then, define variables for revenue (1000) and cost (400), calculate the profit (revenue - cost), and print it. Finally, write a for loop that prints the numbers 1 through 5. Add comments explaining each step."
