# Bonus: Seaborn Scatter (The Executive Scatter)

## The Scenario
The Head of Strategy wants to see the *relationship* between deal size and quantity sold — but broken down by product category and region simultaneously. A simple bar chart won't cut it; she needs a chart where every data point tells a story: position shows deal economics, color shows category, size shows volume.

## Your Mission
Build a publication-quality scatter plot using **Seaborn** that encodes four dimensions: **X-axis** (Unit Price), **Y-axis** (Revenue), **Color** (Product Category), **Size** (Quantity sold — bigger bubbles = bigger volume). Include clear title, axis labels with currency formatting, a legend, and a professional theme. Optional: regression trend lines per category.

## Expected Outcome
A polished `executive_scatter.png` that looks like it belongs in a Harvard Business Review article — with clear encoding, legend, and no default gray.
