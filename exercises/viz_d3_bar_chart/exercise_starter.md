# Bonus: D3 Bar Chart (The Animated Bar Race)

## The Scenario
The Marketing Director saw an animated "bar chart race" on social media showing brand rankings over time and said: *"I want one of those for our sales data."* Static charts can't show how product rankings shift month-by-month. You need a chart that **moves**.

## Your Mission
Using Python to prepare the data and generate an HTML file with embedded **D3.js**, build an interactive, animated bar chart that shows the **top 10 products by revenue** at each month, **animates** through time (bars grow, shrink, reorder), has **smooth transitions**, and includes a **play/pause** button with a month indicator.

## Expected Outcome
A self-contained `bar_chart_race.html` file that you open in a browser and hit "Play" to watch the rankings animate through 12 months of data — built with your company's actual data.
