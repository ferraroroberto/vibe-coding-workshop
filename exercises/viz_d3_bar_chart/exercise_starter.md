# Exercise: Viz 7 - The Animated Bar Race (D3.js)

## The Goal

The Marketing Director saw an animated "bar chart race" on social media showing brand rankings over time and said: *"I want one of those for our sales data."* Static charts can't show how product rankings shift month-by-month. You need a chart that **moves**.

**Your Mission:**
Using Python to prepare the data and generate an HTML file with embedded **D3.js**, build an interactive, animated bar chart that:
1. Shows the **top 10 products by cumulative revenue** at each month of the year.
2. **Animates** through time — bars grow, shrink, and reorder as rankings change.
3. Has **smooth transitions** between months with easing animations.
4. Includes a **play/pause button** and a month indicator.
5. Uses a **color scheme** mapped to product category.

**Expected Outcome:**
A self-contained `bar_chart_race.html` file that you open in a browser and hit "Play" to watch the rankings animate through 12 months of data. It should look like the viral bar chart races on YouTube — but built with your company's actual data. No JavaScript experience required; the Python script generates everything.
